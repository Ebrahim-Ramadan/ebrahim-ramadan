I’m a software engineer. My journey in tech began with computer vision and low-level programming, which laid the foundation for my expertise. Over time, I developed a strong passion for web development, TypeScript, and crafting seamless user experiences.

My early contributions include building automation scripts and optimizing algorithms like [Plagiarism Checker](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan/Express-React-PlagiarismCheck.02), showcasing my ability to tackle foundational computer science challenges.

In 2023, I collaborated on ML-based computer vision projects such as [Drowsiness Detector](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan/Drowsiness_Detector), that detects and alerts individuals when they exhibit signs of drowsiness while driving or operating machinery, and [PlateVision](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan/PlateVision), that detects vehicle license plates and extracts the corresponding text from images.

Throughout 2024, I have been shipping open-sourced tools like [GH Gists Wrapped](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan/gh-gists-unwrapped), [PinSync](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan/PinSync), [ThumbSync](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan/ThumbSync), [MarkForge](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan/MarkForge-md-compiler), [GoGrep](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan/GoGrep). Also some open-sourced CLIs and packages like [TypeShit](https://typeshit-tool.vercel.app/), [PinSync](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan/PinSync).

I do not believe the language or the stack any project is built with determines how great that project is, however I built some cool stuff with [Go](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan?tab=repositories&language=go) and [C++](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan?tab=repositories&language=c%2B%2B) I believe are worth mentioning.

[ChatJJ](https://chat-jj.vercel.app) is born, it allows you to talk to your already installed model on your machine, offline and fast, basically the fastest and most decent UI to get your answers. [Github](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan/vite-pwa-chatjj)

## OSS Contributions

- Authored [Rivo](https://rivo.gallery), the most popular art shop in Egypt, serving all kinds of wall posters and printable vinyls.
- Authored [F0](https://f0-the-millio-dollar-project.vercel.app/): A popular background removal service, faster than most of the tools out there with much fewer subscription fees. [Github](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan/F0)
- I optimized the Python version of [The popular Huffman Coding project](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan/huffman-coding-python-optimized), serving as a powerful tool for data compression and efficient data storage.
- Contributed to [PyMicroHTTP](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan/PyMicroHTTP-CORS-websocket-and-db-supported-and-more), a lightweight minimal HTTP server by [Hassan Ezz](https://github.com/hasssanezzz). I added routing, websocket support, and SQLite integration, CORS, rate limiting, and a basic templating engine.
- Focusing more on (DX), I authored [Serendipity](https://serendipity-ai.vercel.app/), an AI-powered platform for creating and exploring 3D objects. [Github](https://github.com/Ebrahim-Ramadan/serendipity-3d)
- Managed Full Product Lifecycle: Oversaw projects from conception to deployment, ensuring high-quality deliverables and seamless user experiences.

## Looking Ahead

I’m excited to continue exploring the intersection of technology and creativity, building tools that solve real-world problems and inspire others to innovate. Whether it’s through open-source contributions, collaborative projects, or personal initiatives, I love Open Source, and I owe much of my career to it.
